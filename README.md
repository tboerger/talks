# Talks

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/tboerger/talks/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/tboerger/talks)

Within this repository I'm publishing the talks I plan to give or or gave in the past. The presentations are generated with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [DroneCI](https://drone.io/) is taking care about publishing them to my [GitHub page](http://tboerger.github.io/talks/).
